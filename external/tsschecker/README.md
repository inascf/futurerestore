# tsschecker  
_tsschecker is a powerful tool to work with signing technology on iOS devices._

Latest compiled version can be found [here](https://github.com/s0uthwest/tsschecker/releases). Linux version goes later. Windows version is supported, but I will not compile it.

## Features  
* Allows you to get lists of all devices and all iOS/OTA versions for a specific device.
* Can check signing status for default iOS versions and beta iPSW's (by specifying a `BuildManifest.plist`)
* Works without specifying any device relevant values to check signing status, but can be used to save blobs when given an ECID and the option `--print-tss-response` (although there are better tools to do this).
* __If you want to save blobs with recommended ApNonce, please, see [this file](https://github.com/s0uthwest/tsschecker/blob/master/nonces.txt).__

tsschecker is not only meant to be used to check signing status, but also to explore Apple's TSS servers.
By using all of its customization possibilities, you might discover a combination of devices and iOS versions that is now getting signed but wasn't getting signed before.

## Compiling
Open terminal and execute the command: `./autogen.sh && make` or use Xcode project.

### Some about curl for ubuntu
Follow [this guide](https://dev.to/jake/using-libcurl3-and-libcurl4-on-ubuntu-1804-bionic-184g) to use tsschecker on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) as it requires libcurl3 which cannot coexist with libcurl4 on this OS.
